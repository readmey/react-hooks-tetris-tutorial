# React-Hooks-Tetris-Tutorial
Building a Tetris game with React to test new hooks feature and playing around. Who does not like TETRIS? The good old times with my Gameboy Color <3 :

#### DEMO: [click here](https://readmey.github.io/react-hooks-tetris-tutorial/)

Just use this tutorial as reference from [GameDev Tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU) and adapted following:

- Rewrite StyledStartButton to have a CustomButton passing through props.children
- Add pause and continue game functionality
- Move the separated styles (StyledComponents) into the components file
- Add the retro Tetris game sound (Tetris without the Tetris music is NOT Tetris :o)
- Add own Tetrominos stylings (inspired by Lego)
- Add responsive keyboard
- Make game playable on mobile versions
- Add Highscores
